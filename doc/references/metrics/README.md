# What metrics are used to evaluate the results of multi-label classification?

A range of metrics are used to evaluate the results of multi-label classification. Diao (2022) introduces a hierarchical multi-level class label for multi-class multi-target tracking, while Mangolin (2020) uses F-Score and AUC-PR to evaluate a multimodal approach for movie genre classification. PetkoviÄ‡ (2020) proposes ensemble-based feature ranking scores, and Alazaidah (2020) presents a multi-label ranking algorithm based on positive pairwise correlations among labels. Gao (2023) focuses on multi-label feature selection based on Min-Relevance Label, and Heydarian (2022) introduces the Multi-Label Confusion Matrix (MLCM) for performance assessment. Gharebaghi (2022) presents LP-MLTSVM, a Laplacian Multi-Label Twin Support Vector Machine for semi-supervised classification, and Kulkarni (2018) proposes an Interactive Multi-Label Consensus Labeling Model for Multiple Labeler Judgments. These studies collectively demonstrate the diverse range of metrics and approaches used to evaluate multi-label classification.
