    "\n",
    "1. The original dataset is a collection publicly accessible customer reviews/complaints scraped from [Hellopeter](https://www.hellopeter.com/) site between 2021 and 2023. This dataset was [created](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/01_hellopeter/01-01_retrieve_data.ipynb) in another research project investigating: [Evaluating Customer Satisfaction and Preferences in the Telecommunications Industry: A Comparative Analysis of Survey Data and Online Reviews](https://github.com/JohnnyFoulds/dsm050-2023-apr/blob/master/notebooks/04_draft/04-04_cw02.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data selection was perform in the `00-01_data_selection` notebook based on the following criteria.\n",
    "    - Reviews from the for the 5 month period from **2022-06-01** to **2023-06-30** were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Only reviews from the **Vodacom** telecommunications company were selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Very short, or very long reviews were removed. Reviews between from **10** to **100** words were selected. The word count was calculated using a basic `.str.split().str.len()` which is sufficient for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The unlabeled data was then labeled in the `01-02_batch_classification` notebook using Generative AI.\n",
    "    - The **Mistral 7B v0.2** Large Language Model (LLM) were hosted on the local servier with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/mistral). Please refer to the `01-01_classification_test` notebook for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The classification was done using multiple prompts similar to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques for classification. _Implementation details can be found in the `src` directory._\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classification was done based on the categories defined in `src/config/category_definitions.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It took an average of **7 seconds** to classify a single review.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The data labels was then converted into a format suitable for modeling in the `02-01_data_preperation` notebook."
