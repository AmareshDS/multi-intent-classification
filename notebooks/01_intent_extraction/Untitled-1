'**Vodacom biggest disappointment ðŸ˜¤**\n\nHi. \n\nSo because lack of communication, my account was debited twice this month and when I called them to fix the matter details are being explained to me even though the error was not my fault. \n\nSo my budget for food is *****ed and vodacom cannot care less for this situation. You being a client to them for so many years mean nothing. I swear these retailers think nothing of their clients with all the promises always made when you coming in as new business.'
